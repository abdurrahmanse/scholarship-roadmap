          description: "Yes, absolutely! In the US and Canada, the majority of CS PhD students are admitted directly after a Bachelor's degree. Direct-entry PhD programs provide 100% full tuition remission, a guaranteed monthly living stipend ($30,000–$50,000/year), and health insurance from Day 1. In Europe, a Master's degree is legally required prior to doctoral enrollment.",

          description: "No, a first-author main conference paper is not mandatory, though it is a strong positive signal. Admissions committees look for research maturity: conference workshop papers (NeurIPS/ICLR workshops), verified arXiv preprints, co-authored conference submissions, reproducible GitHub codebases, and strong letters from active AI researchers confirming your problem-solving independence.",

Institutions like MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, University of Washington, University of Michigan, and UIUC have permanently made the GRE test-blind or abolished it. Only take the GRE if a specific safe-tier institution on your list strictly requires it, and aim for Quant >= 167.",

          description: "Yes. In AI/ML, research output and technical contributions vastly outweigh GPA. You can mitigate a lower cumulative GPA by: (1) Highlighting an upward trend in your final 2 years of advanced math/CS courses; (2) Releasing a citable arXiv preprint and clean open-source PyTorch repository; (3) Securing an enthusiastic recommendation letter from an active AI researcher; and (4) Directly connecting with an Assistant Professor whose active grant aligns with your skills.",

Avoid buzzwords like 'surveillance', 'autonomous weapons', or 'military tracking'.

However, the vast majority of 2nd-year+ AI PhD students take 3-month summer research internships at top industrial labs (Google DeepMind, Meta FAIR, Microsoft Research, OpenAI, Apple, Anthropic, NVIDIA). These internships pay $10,000–$15,000 per month plus housing allowances, providing substantial financial savings while generating high-impact conference papers.",
